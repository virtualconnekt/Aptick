## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Aptos CLI
- Git

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aptick.git
cd aptick

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up smart contract development
cd smartcontract
aptos init --network devnet

# Set up frontend development
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run smart contract tests
cd smartcontract
aptos move test

# Run frontend tests (when available)
cd frontend
npm test
```

## Coding Standards

### Smart Contract (Move)

- Use clear, descriptive function and variable names
- Include comprehensive documentation comments
- Follow Move's naming conventions (snake_case)
- Add appropriate error codes and messages
- Include unit tests for all functions

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Ensure responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### SDK (TypeScript)

- Provide comprehensive type definitions
- Include detailed JSDoc documentation
- Follow semantic versioning for releases
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Include comprehensive examples

## Commit Guidelines

We use conventional commits for clear history:

```
type(scope): description

- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- docs: documentation changes
- style: code style changes
- refactor: code refactoring
- test: adding or updating tests
- chore: maintenance tasks
```

Examples:
```
